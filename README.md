He began his immersion with the International Computer Academy STEP (now after renaming, Computer Academy TOP), a course called the small computer Academy. The training took 5 years, ending in 2024, at the end of May. The training took place full-time, 3 hours a week.  The materials passed there can be divided into several groups: python programming, video editors, photo editors, 3D modeling, website creation, game creation, robotics.
 I took a course from Udemy on machine learning in 2022.
